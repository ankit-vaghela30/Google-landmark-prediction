# Team-Bulldawgs

## Team-Bulldawgs implementation of Final Project 5 (Google Landmark Prediction) of Data Science Practicum Spring 2018

### Project Description
With the vast amount of landmark images on the Internet, the time has come to think about landmarks globally, namely to build a landmark prediction engine, on the scale of the entire earth.

Develop a technology that can predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize the photo collections.The project challenges to build models that recognize the correct landmark in a dataset of challenging test images. The Kaggle challenge provides access to annotated data which consists of various links to google images along with their respective labeled classes.

### Data-Set

The dataset for this Kaggle competition is available on the following website: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-challenge/data

File descriptions:

`train.csv` - the training image set

`test.csv` - the test set containing the test images for which we may predict landmarks

`sample submission.csv` - a sample submission file format

There are overall approximately 1.2 million train images with 15,000 unique classes, whereas 0.1 million testing images for labeling and classification.
